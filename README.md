Concrete Strength Estimator Regression model using Keras.
In this project, I have built a regression model using the deep learning Keras library, and then I experimented that with increasing the number of training epochs and changing number of hidden layers and I made observations of how changing these parameters impacted the performance of the model. A regression model using the Keras library to model the concrete compressive strength data.

Project is divided in 4 sections (A, B, C, D as mentioned below).

Model is trained with 70% data and tested by 30% of data.

For Section A, B and C: 1 hidden layer and 10 nodes each layer Neural Network is used.

For Section D: 3 hidden layers and 10 nodes for each layer Neural Network is used.

The predictors in the data of concrete strength include:

1).Cement
2).Blast Furnace Slag
3).Fly Ash
4).Water
5).Superplasticizer
6).Coarse Aggregate
7).Fine Aggregate.
The target in the data is 'Strength'.
